## MATH 4610

### This is a repository for my Intro to Numerical Analysis course (MATH 4610). Here I will publish links to completed assignments and my software manual.

### Completed Tasksheets

A table of contents of all completed tasksheets can be accessed [here](Tasksheets/toc/tasks_toc.md) to view all completed homework assignments.

### Software Manual

To document algorithms developed during this semester, a software manual has been created which can be accessed [here](software_manual/toc/manual_toc.md). The software manual is comprised of short descriptions of the algorithms implemented in this course. For each piece of code developed, there is an entry in the software manual.

<!-- You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/palmeredholm/math4610/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/palmeredholm/math4610/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
