* **Entry 1.** [Single Precision Machine Epsilon:](../smaceps.md)
```
This routine will compute the single precision value for the machine epsilon or the number of
digits in the representation of real numbers in single precision. This is a routine for analyzing
the behavior of any computer. This usually will need to be run one time for each computer...
```
* **Entry 2.** [Double Precision Machine Epsilon:](../dmaceps.md)
```
This routine will compute the double precision value for the machine epsilon or the number of
digits in the representation of real numbers in single precision. This is a routine for analyzing
the behavior of any computer. Thisusually will need to be run one time for each computer...
```
* **Entry 3.** [Absolute Error:](../abserror.md)
```
This routine will compute the absolute error in approximating a number, x, with another number,
y. This is a routine for computing the accuracy of an estimate...
```
* **Entry 4.** [Relative Error:](../relerror.md)
```
This routine will compute the relative error in approximating a number, x, with another number,
y. This is a routine for computing the accuracy of an estimate...
```
* **Entry 5.** [Python Graphics in Matplotlib](../graphics.md)
```
This routine will graph functions using Matplotlib. This routine can be used to compare the
graphs of different functions to analyze their properties...
```
* **Entry 6.** [Fixed Point Iteration](../fxd_pt_iter.md)
```
This routine will compute the root of a function using fixed point iteration. With a good guess
(i.e., a point close to a root of the function), the routine will return an approximation of the
closest root to the guess.
```
* **Entry 7.** [Bisection](../bisection.md)
```
This routine will compute the root of a function using the bisection method. As long as we know
that there exists one root in some interval, via the intermediate value theorem, we can
approximate the value of that root down to a specified precision level.
