* **Entry 1.** [Single Precision Machine Epsilon:](../smaceps.md)
```
This routine will compute the single precision value for the machine epsilon or the number of
digits in the representation of real numbers in single precision. This is a routine for analyzing
the behavior of any computer. This usually will need to be run one time for each computer...
```
* **Entry 2.** [Double Precision Machine Epsilon:](../dmaceps.md)
```
This routine will compute the double precision value for the machine epsilon or the number of
digits in the representation of real numbers in single precision. This is a routine for analyzing
the behavior of any computer. Thisusually will need to be run one time for each computer...
```
* **Entry 3.** [Absolute Error:](../abserror.md)
```
This routine will compute the absolute error in approximating a number, x, with another number,
y. This is a routine for computing the accuracy of an estimate...
```
* **Entry 4.** [Relative Error:](../relerror.md)
```
This routine will compute the relative error in approximating a number, x, with another number,
y. This is a routine for computing the accuracy of an estimate...
```
* **Entry 5.** [Python Graphics in Matplotlib](../graphics.md)
```
This routine will graph simple functions in Matplotlib. Only simple functions can be graphed, for
example, this routine cannot handle trigonometric functions, logarithmic, or exponential functions...
